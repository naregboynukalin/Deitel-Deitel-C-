// Create an Account class that a bank might use to represent customers’ bank accounts.
// Include a data member of type int to representthe account balance. Provide a constructor
// that receives an initial balance and uses it to initializethe data member.The constructor 
// should validate the initial balance to ensure that it’s greater than or equal to 0. If not,
// set the balance to 0 and display an error message indicating that the initial balance was invalid.
// Provide three member functions. Member function credit should add an amount to the current 
// balance. Member function debit should withdraw money from the Account and ensure that the
// debit amount does not exceed the Account’s balance. If it does,the balance should be left unchanged
// and the function should print a message indicating "Debit amount exceeded account balance."
// Member function getBalance should return the current balance. Createa program that creates
// two Account objects and tests the member functions of class Account.
