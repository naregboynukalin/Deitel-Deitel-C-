// Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can 
// estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other
// advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion.
// Theapplication should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost
// per day of driving to work:
// a) Total miles driven per day.
// b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
// c) Average miles per gallon.
// e) Tolls per day.
